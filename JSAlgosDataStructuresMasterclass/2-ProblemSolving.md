# Problem Solving

## The Process (in outline)
- Understand the problem
- Explore concrete examples
- Break it down
- Solve / simplify
- Look back and refactor

## The Process (in detail)

### Understand the Problem
- can i restate the problem in my own words?
- what are the inputs that go into the problem?
- what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
- can the outputs be determined from the inputs? i.e. do i have enough information to solve the problem?
- how should i label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

### Explore Concrete Examples
- start with simple examples
  - write down simple input(s) & corresponding output(s)
- progress to more complex examples
- explore examples with empty inputs
- explore examples with invalid inputs

### Break it Down
- pseudocode

### Solve & Simplify
- solve the problem. and if you can't solve a simpler problem.

### Look back & refactor
- can you check the results
- can you derive the result differently
- can you understand it at a glance
- can you use the result of method for some other problem
- can you improve the performance of your solution
- can you think of other ways to refactor
- how have other people solved this problem
